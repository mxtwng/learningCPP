# learningCPP

##This project/repo is for mxtw to learn and document their C++ studying journey

Instruction on how to make new function: <br>
    1. Make .h with #pragma once + functionName();  <br>
    2. Make .cpp, include the .h previously created, write function <br>
    3. Go to tasks.json in project folder, in args: add "path/to/your/newCPPfile.cpp" (local, i.e. no need for ~/ or @/) <br>
    4. build/run main.cpp <br>
<hr>

Mainly follows the progression of Algorithm book (python).<br>
Chapter 1: Algorithm.<br>
Chapter 2: Searching and Sorting algorithms, Brute force. <br>
Chapter 3: Recursion. <br>
Chapter 4: Divide and conquer. <br>
Chapter 5: Greedy. <br>
Chapter 6: Dynamic programming. <br>
Chapter 7: Basic data structures, Tree. <br>
Chapter 8: Graph's algorithms. <br>
Chapter 9: Brute force + Backtracking.

!!This also includes studying from USACO and VNOI roadmap (reminder to checkout codedream)
!!bro we can code together on ide.usaco.guide
!!exercises: hackerank, leetcode, codeforces, cses,...
